* IBM is $\textsf{\textcolor{blue}{darkblue}}$
* Nvidia is $\textsf{\textcolor{limegreen}{limegreen}}$
* RedHat is $\textsf{\textcolor{red}{red}}$


# Content 

- The content is a key-value dictionary according to the JSON specâ€” A very friendly format for Python or JavaScript. 

- Keys are firm names as "Textual Strings" in Unicode to map the JSON spec (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt) -- "JSON text SHALL be encoded in Unicode". 
Values are colours accepted by MatplotLib (see https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colors.html). Those can be X11/CSS4 and xkcd colors, RGB tuples among many other ways of specifying colors.
